# 01 Semantic Elements, Alt Attributes and Titles


## Description

```
As a bootcamp student, I want to be able to facilitate the website's user experience
by using semantic elements in my code as much as possible, 
adding the Alt attribute when having images, and provide a more organized
and versatile website. 
By using semantic elements, users will have a clear idea about the content and structure of the website.
